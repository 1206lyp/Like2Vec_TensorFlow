    "This is an implementation of Like2Vec using TensorFlow.  This class will allow you to generate word2vec like embeddings for users or items.  The theory behind Like2Vec can be found here: http://www.perozzi.net/publications/14_kdd_deepwalk.pdf.  I implement Like2Vec by altering TensorFlow's example to generate word2vec embeddings.  The TensorFlow word2vec example I used can be found here : https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r0.8/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py.  I attempted to use sklearn's TSNE class, as it does in the TensorFlow example, but I was having trouble with the gradient used to train TSNE generating inf/nan values.  I decided to use a different TSNE function to plot my embeddings, which can be found here : https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/.\n",
